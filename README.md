Moved to RestExpress/common sub-module.  Please see https://github.com/RestExpress/RestExpress

Confusion point: the last release of RestExpress-Common as it's own, stand-alone repository
was version 1.0.3. However, when RestExpress-Common was combined with RestExpress (core)
as a sub-module, it was changed to track with the same version as RestExpress.  At that
time RestExpress was at version 0.9.4.

Consequently, RestExpress-Common version 0.9.4 is actually newer than RestExpress-Common
version 1.0.3... just so's ya know... sorry!
